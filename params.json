{"name":"Brickoptimizer","tagline":"brickoptimizer - optimize the price of Bricklinks Wanted List","body":"This piece of software is intended to be used by the Legoâ„¢ aficionados.\r\n\r\nIt uses Bricklink (http://www.bricklink.com) Wanted Lists to generate forms so you can buy bricks in the\r\nleast number of stores as possible paying the least price you can get.\r\n\r\nLibraries needed to run Brickoptimizer:\r\nlibtidy (http://tidy.sourceforge.net)\r\nlibcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c)\r\nlibcurl is necessary to retrieve Bricklink web pages whilst libtidy is responsible for parsing HTML pages.\r\n\r\nThe idea is based on Brickficiency (https://code.google.com/p/brickficiency) which intends to do the same\r\nthing (and it do it perfectly) but somehow didn't work on my 64 bits computer because the binary produced\r\nfrom Perl language has some restrictions.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask, change, complain, curse or improve. I'd be glad to hear from you.\r\n\r\nDownload Brickoptimizer binary:\r\nhttp://www.4shared.com/zip/_sLO3HBE/brickoptimizer.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\nusage: brickoptimizer \\<username\\> \\<password\\> \\<wanted list name\\> \\<session_id\\>\r\n\r\n- \\<username\\>: Bricklink.com username\r\n- \\<password\\>: Bricklink.com password\r\n- \\<wanted list name\\>: Name of the Wanted List with items you want to buy\r\n- \\<session_id\\>: A session ID number of your browser session with Bricklink. It can be obtained by viewing\tthe source from any store buying form. The \"b=\" part of the \\<FORM METHOD=\"POST\"...\\> is the session ID you need.\r\n\r\nBrickoptimizer will login to your Bricklink account to gather information on the provided Wanted List name. It will print URLs of the stores with the best prices for your items and create HTML forms to add the items to your cart.\r\n\r\nThese forms will only work correctly if you provide a valid session ID. A session ID is obtained each time you login to Bricklink.com. The connection from Brickoptimizer will have a different session ID from your browser session ID.\r\n\r\nThe HTML forms will add the items to the cart of the session provided. If you provide the session ID of your browser, it will be easy to verify that the items were added to your cart.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the session ID of your browser, follow the steps below:\r\n- Open http://www.bricklink.com/ on the web browser of your choice;\r\n- Login to your account;\r\n- Open any store Add to Cart form (any page from any store where you select the number of items to add);\r\n- Open the source code of this web page;\r\n- Search for the line \"\\<FORM METHOD=\"POST\" ACTION=\"storeDetail.asp?...\\>\"\r\n- The session ID will be the number (may be negative) after the \"b=\"\r\n\r\nIf you do not provide a valid session ID, the form will still be created, but the items will not show on the cart of your web browser. You can still change the session ID of the forms aftwards by editing the HTML files created by Brickoptimizer.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

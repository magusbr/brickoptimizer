{"name":"Brickoptimizer","tagline":"brickoptimizer - optimize the price of Bricklinks Wanted List","body":"This piece of software is intended to be used by the Legoâ„¢ aficionados.\r\n\r\nIt uses Bricklink (http://www.bricklink.com) Wanted Lists to generate forms so you can buy\r\nbricks in the least number of stores as possible paying the least price you can get.\r\n\r\nLibraries needed to run Brickoptimizer\r\n- libtidy (http://tidy.sourceforge.net)\r\n- libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c)\r\nlibcurl is necessary to retrieve Bricklink web pages whilst libtidy is responsible for parsing\r\nHTML pages.\r\n\r\nThe idea is based on Brickficiency (https://code.google.com/p/brickficiency) which intends to do\r\nthe same thing (and it do it perfectly) but somehow didn't work on my 64 bits computer because\r\nthe binary produced from Perl language has some restrictions.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask, change, complain, curse or improve.\r\nI'd be glad to hear from you.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

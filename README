brickoptimizer - optimize the price of Bricklinks Wanted List


This piece of software is intended to be used by the Legoâ„¢ aficionados.

It uses Bricklink (http://www.bricklink.com) Wanted Lists to generate forms so you can buy bricks in the
least number of stores as possible paying the least price you can get.

Libraries needed to run Brickoptimizer:
libtidy (http://tidy.sourceforge.net)
libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c)
libcurl is necessary to retrieve Bricklink web pages whilst libtidy
is responsible for parsing HTML pages.

The idea is based on Brickficiency (https://code.google.com/p/brickficiency) which intends to do the same
thing (and it do it perfectly) but somehow didn't work on my 64 bits computer because the binary produced
from Perl language has some restrictions.

Feel free to ask, change, complain, curse or improve. I'd be glad to hear from you.
